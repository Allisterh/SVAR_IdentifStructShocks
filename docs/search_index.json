These responses correspond to the effect, over time, of an exogenous intervention that propagates through the economy, as modelled by a system of simultaneous equations. Over the last decades, several methodologies have been proposed so as to estimate these responses. The objective of this course, developed by Kenza Benhima and Jean-Paul Renne, is to provide an exhaustive view of these methodologies and to provide students with tools enabling them to implement them in various contexts. Codes associated with this course are part of the AEC package, which is available on GitHub.
